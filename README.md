## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Less Pre-processor
- Flexbox
- CSS animations
- Vanilla JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

With this project i learned how to use JQuery and Less. I already had experience with other pre-processor so it was really easy to understand less and even though it was easy the experience was fun and a good implementation to my toolbox. JQuery was something almost completely new to me, as i don't have a lot of experience with JS but the challenge of understanding it was a good test for my learning ability.

### Continued development

In future projects i would like to learn more JavaScript because i noticed that i got stuck multiple times on simple problems and i think is time to get even deeper in this language.
