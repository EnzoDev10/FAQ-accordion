## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
- Navigate the questions and hide/show answers using keyboard navigation alone
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Less Pre-processor
- Flexbox
- CSS animations
- JavaScript
- [JQuery](https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.min.js)
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

With this project i learned how to use JQuery and Less. I already had experience with other pre-processor so it was really easy to understand less and even though it was easy the experience was fun and a good implementation to my toolbox. JQuery was something almost completely new to me, as i don't have a lot of experience with JS but the challenge of understanding it was a good test for my learning ability.

### Continued development

In future projects i would like to learn more JavaScript because i noticed that i got stuck multiple times on simple problems and i think is time to get even deeper in this language.
